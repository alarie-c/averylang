# Lexer

8/10/2024
The lexer is almost done at this point. I need to add a couple things I forgot like commas, periods, colons, semicolons, etc. I don't know how I remembered ampersand and hash but not those 4 some reason.

Eventually I will have to add more exceptions to support more features in the syntax. I am confident in my ability to do this, though, as the lexer is already pretty simple as is and I don't think I'll have trouble writing a few exception among the mess of code in that file.

**In summary**
Lexer done, whoop whoop. I will have to add more later though.
Onto parsing, if I can ever figure that out...

# Avery Programming Language
This is a language I'm using primarily to learn about compilers in Rust. The goal is to make a language that is inherently suited to data science, data analysis, data visualization, statistics, etc.

**Timeline**
8/8 - redo everything :D

**Major Projects**
- [ ] Lexer
- [ ] Parser

## Lexer
Major Goals:
1. Should have minimal overhead
2. Should have simple and easy control flow
3. Match blocks are abstracted
4. Methods and helper functions return similar Option types
5. Elegant handling of EOF condition checks
